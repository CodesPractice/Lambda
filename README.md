# Lambda Functions

This repository contains a clear and beginner-friendly example that demonstrates how to use lambda expressions with delegates in C#.NET. It’s perfect for anyone wanting to understand the difference between expression lambdas and statement lambdas using simple, console-based examples.

📁 What’s Inside
✅ Expression - Lambda 

Learn how to use short, single-line lambda expressions to perform operations like squaring a number or multiplying it by a constant.

✅ Statement - Lambda 

Understand how to write multi-line logic inside lambdas, such as checking whether a number is even or odd, using if statements within a lambda body.

C# Events with Lambda Expressions
This example demonstrates how to use delegates and events in C# with lambda expressions to handle balance changes in a simple bank account scenario.

📌 How to Use

Open the solution in Visual Studio or VSCode, then run the Program.cs file. The console application creates a Button object, subscribes to its OnClick event, and triggers the event by simulating a button click. You will see the event flow demonstrated through console messages.
